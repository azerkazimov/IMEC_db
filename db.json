This instrument uses a non-intrusive ultrasonic sensor to measure the real-time density of mineral slurries under high-density levels and at very large pipes. Moreover, the SDMs have a robust design with sensors made of highly abrasion-resistant materials, making them ideal for rough process conditions. Rhosonics helps mineral processing plants and other industries to replace nuclear density gauges by non-hazardous ultrasonic technology. Consequently, operators can achieve process optimization in a safer, more reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective way. This is how Rhosonics contributes to a greener and smarter industry. On November 2nd,2023, Rhosonics released the latest version of the SDM, the SDM ECO. The SDM ECO is an upgrade of the SDM-4 in terms of accuracy, response time, operating temperature range, and sensor design. In addition to that, the SDM ECO can be controlled by a 7’’ touchscreen display, laptop, via optional Wi-Fi, or from anywhere with server access.",
