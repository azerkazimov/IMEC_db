This instrument uses a non-intrusive ultrasonic sensor to measure the real-time density of mineral slurries under high-density levels and at very large pipes. Moreover, the SDMs have a robust design with sensors made of highly abrasion-resistant materials, making them ideal for rough process conditions. Rhosonics helps mineral processing plants and other industries to replace nuclear density gauges by non-hazardous ultrasonic technology. Consequently, operators can achieve process optimization in a safer, more reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective way. This is how Rhosonics contributes to a greener and smarter industry. On November 2nd,2023, Rhosonics released the latest version of the SDM, the SDM ECO. The SDM ECO is an upgrade of the SDM-4 in terms of accuracy, response time, operating temperature range, and sensor design. In addition to that, the SDM ECO can be controlled by a 7’’ touchscreen display, laptop, via optional Wi-Fi, or from anywhere with server access.",

They offer 4 or 8 alarm outputs or digital inputs, which can be used to activate warning systems or stop machinery, and manage measurements. An OPC Server enables publishing of alarm statuses and expert recommendations through NEST software, while email notifications can be sent to predefined addresses for alarm conditions. Additionally, MVX and MV-120 are compatible with Wi-Fi, 3G-4G, and wired Ethernet communications, with unsent data stored in internal memory to prevent data loss.",
