EMP® Staior design comes with holes that can be measured as a 6Ge connected to the heat exchanger. The hole design allows for smaller air bubbles to form, which provides better bonding with finer ore particles in the cleaning and cleaning circuits. Optionally, in the cable flotation circuit, these holes can be closed with polyurethane caps and larger air bubbles can be formed.",

This instrument uses a non-intrusive ultrasonic sensor to measure the real-time density of mineral slurries under high-density levels and at very large pipes. Moreover, the SDMs have a robust design with sensors made of highly abrasion-resistant materials, making them ideal for rough process conditions. Rhosonics helps mineral processing plants and other industries to replace nuclear density gauges by non-hazardous ultrasonic technology. Consequently, operators can achieve process optimization in a safer, more reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective way. This is how Rhosonics contributes to a greener and smarter industry. On November 2nd,2023, Rhosonics released the latest version of the SDM, the SDM ECO. The SDM ECO is an upgrade of the SDM-4 in terms of accuracy, response time, operating temperature range, and sensor design. In addition to that, the SDM ECO can be controlled by a 7’’ touchscreen display, laptop, via optional Wi-Fi, or from anywhere with server access.",
